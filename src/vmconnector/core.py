The 'vmconnector' module defines classes and methods for establishing a 
connection to VMware vCenter and/or ESX servers.

It's purpose is to provide the basic primitives and interfaces required for
connecting and disconnecting from a VMware vCenter server, thus allowing it to
serve as a base for extending it and integrating it into other tools, e.g. VMware pollers.
